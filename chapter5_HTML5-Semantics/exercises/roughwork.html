        <p>This header has a role attribute of <em>banner</em> indicating that it contains site-specific content such as the site-name and logo.... I've cheated a little bit here and added a h2 element that is specific to this page.</p>
        <p>Only one element with the role <em>banner</em> is allowed per page, there is also a <em>heading</em> role that could be applied to article or section headings.</p>

                A motor vehicle has a <dfn id="vin" title="Vehicle Identification Number - Title attribute within dfn tag"><abbr>VIN</abbr></dfn> that is unique. Over the years, the <abbr title="Vehicle Identification Number">VIN</abbr> has had different formats, based on the vehicle manufacturer.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the United States, the <a href="#vin">
                    <abbr title="Vehicle Identification Number">VIN</abbr>
                </a>
                was standardized to a 17 character format where
                the 10th character of the
                <abbr title="Vehicle Identification Number">VIN</abbr>
                represents the year of the vehicle.
            </p>
            <p>Yo - the definition is contained in the 1st paragraph, give the definition an ID and it is possible to link to the definition. The <em>&lt;dfn&gt;</em> tag has been given a <em>title</em> attribute which shows the title when moused over. All the other instances of VIN use the abbr title attribute to show the tooltip.</p>
