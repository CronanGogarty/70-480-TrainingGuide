        <p>This chapter is a description of the various versions of Visual Studio. There are installation guides and some practical examples of creating solutions, opening solutions and using the installed templates as a basis for solutions and projects. This chapter also introduces Blend for Visual Studio 2012 which I found useful as I had not previously used that project.</p>
