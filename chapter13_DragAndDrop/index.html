    <h1>Chapter 12:Drag and Drop With HTML5</h1>
    <p>
        HTML5 Drag and Drop is awful - it is a return to the bad old days of cross-browser incompatibilities!<br />
        None of the examples in the book work in Firefox. The 2nd example using the dataTransfer object didn't work in any of the browsers.<br />
        At that point I decided to abandon the chapter, maybe I will find some cross-browser solutions in the future.
